## Tamil Language Data Collection

This project is part of the Aya Initiative, an open science project that aims to build a state-of-the-art multilingual generative language model. This repository contains one of the scrappers built to collect data for the Tamil language.

## About Aya Initiative

The Aya Initiative is a global, collaborative effort to build a cutting-edge multilingual generative language model. It harnesses the collective knowledge and contributions of individuals from around the world to develop a model that is open-source and accessible to everyone.

## Purpose of this Project

The data collected will be used to train the Aya language model. The data will be collected from various sources, including public domain books, websites, and other online resources. The data will be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure that it is of high quality and suitable for use in the language model.

## How to Contribute

You can contribute to this project by providing data for your language. If you have access to any public domain books, websites, or other online resources that contain content in your language, please consider sharing it with us. You can also help by reviewing and cleaning the data that has already been collected.
